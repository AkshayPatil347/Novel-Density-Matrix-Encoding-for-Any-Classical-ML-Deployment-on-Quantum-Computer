Density Matrix encoding is novel way of encoding classical data in the form of matrix , to emulate the result of any classical ML algorithm using Qiskit Library with same or better accuracy than classical ML algorithm ran on classical hardware, it involves finding the unitary matrix for the classical ML algorithm that transitions from the input density matrix i.e by default set in qiskit to an output density matrix, which is density matrix encoding of the classical ML Solution Matrix i.e result matrix.In Quantum Information theory the unitary matrix (U) for this transition can be found by the equation rho_output = U(rho_in)U^+ , now for finding U , we can follow this procedure , Find X = (rho_output)(rho_in)^-1. As (rho_in)^-1, our unitary matrix is U = e^(iX) , for default input density matrix set in qiskit does not exist , we can use pseudo-inverse and find X, then singular value decompose SVD of X in to A,S,B , and find the unitary matrix by , U = A(e^(iS))B , as X is considered as Hermitian Operator for the quantum circuit whose unitary we have to find, that unitary is nothing but the unitary of the whole quantum circuit. Next comes design of quantum circuit to parameterize these unitaries.
Note - Here - For finding the unitary , the solution is not unique as SVD of X is not unique, and can lead to error from actual output density matrix and obtained output density matrix, but can is within accuracy limits of 1e-5 per element of the matrix , characterized by Frobenius Norm in the code.
Note - This can be used for Quantum emulating any classical ML algorithm, whose result data can be converted to matrix form on Classical Hardware using Qiskit Library, Recommendation System is taken as a use case for now.
